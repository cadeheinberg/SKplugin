The most important class is Fighter.java

A Fighter instance is created for every player
that joins the server.

It stores all of the players stats and holds
key methods that are used during the game.

When the player leaves the server,
to save the their stats the
data held by the Fighter instance is
uploaded to the MySQL server.

When the player rejoins, the data
is then downloaded from the MySQL server 
and injected into the newly made 
Fighter instance for the player!
