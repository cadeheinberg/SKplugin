# The most important class is Fighter.java.
```
It stores all of the players stats and holds
key methods that are used during the game.
As the player plays progresses, their 
Fighter instance is updated respectively.
```

# A Fighter instance is created for every player that joins the server.
```
When the player leaves the server,
to save the their stats the
data held by the Fighter instance is
uploaded to the MySQL server.
```

```
When the player rejoins, the data
is then downloaded from the MySQL server 
and injected into the newly made 
Fighter instance for the player!
